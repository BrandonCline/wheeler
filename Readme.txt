This is the Wheeler programming language. It is probably different from other languages you've seen. 

There is a REPL that is handy for playing with the language. Just run ./bigwheel

Wheeler doesn't have much implemented yet but you can do some simple things in the REPL such as printing strings and adding numbers. Try it!

There is also an interpreter that you can execute from the commandline like so: ./wheeler

Wheeler is currently built on top of Python 2.5 and also runs well in 2.6. Python 3 hasn't been tested but may be.
