What's going on here?
---------------------
This is the Wheeler programming language. It is probably different from other languages you've seen. 

There is a REPL that is handy for playing with the language. Just run ./bigwheel

Wheeler doesn't have much implemented yet but you can do some simple things in the REPL such as printing strings or experimenting with transitions (one of the core language features).

There is also an interpreter that you can execute from the command line like so: ./wheeler
